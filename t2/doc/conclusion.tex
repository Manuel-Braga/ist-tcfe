\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\par In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing an RC circuit has been
achieved. Static, time and frequency analyses have been performed both
theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the
NGSpice tool. The simulation results matched the theoretical results
precisely, with the slight differences (in the order of magnitude of $1e-15$) being associated to software precision and roundings done both by Octave and NGSpice. The reason for this almost perfect match is the fact that this is a fairly simple circuit, with only one capacitor and the remaining linear components. Any differences will relate to the capacitor model used by NGSpice. For more complex circuits, these differences are expected to be greater.

In conclusion, the results presented in this report show that this model can be used to simulate this circuit with great accuracy.
