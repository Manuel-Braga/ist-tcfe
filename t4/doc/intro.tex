The objective of this laboratory assignment is to model an audio amplifier circuit, that can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:cir} and is comprised of a gain stage and an output stage.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by simulation. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
