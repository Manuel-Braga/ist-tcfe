The objective of this laboratory assignment is to model and simulate an audio amplifier circuit. This circuit is divided into a gain and an output stages, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:cir}.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is presented using Octave. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by simulation using NGSpice. The resistor model used is that of a Phillips BJT. In Section~\ref{sec:comparison}, the theoretical and simulated results are compared and discussed. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
