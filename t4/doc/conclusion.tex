\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


Despite the differences exposed in Section~\ref{sec:comparison}, the results obtained for the both the input and output impedances are satisfactory. The simulated input impedance result is acceptable as the range for output impedances for microphones is about 50-500 $Ohm$. This means that this circuit could be used as a microphone amplifier.
Similarly, the value of the output impedance also falls in the normal range of speakers impedances, specifically the 8 $Ohm$ impedance targeted in this assignment.
Finally, the circuit operates extremely well from 20Hz to 20kHz, which makes it an excellent candidate for being used as an amplifier, as desired.
Therefore, we believe that the objective of this assignment was achieved.
