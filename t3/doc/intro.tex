% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to model an AC/DC converter circuit, that can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:cir} and is comprised of a transformer, an envelope detector and a voltage regulator.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation. In Section~\ref{sec:comparison}, the results obtained in Section~\ref{sec:simulation} are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
