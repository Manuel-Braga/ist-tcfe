\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of creating and analysing an AC/DC converter circuit has been achieved. Analyses have been performed both theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the Ngspice tool. The simulation and theoretical results differed slightly. This is explained by the non-linear behavior of the diodes that are part of the circuit. Nevertheless, these small deviations did not compromise the goal of this assignment. 

To conclude, we believe that the model presented shows a satisfactory precision and thus can be used as an AC/DC converter circuit.
