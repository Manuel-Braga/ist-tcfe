\section{Theoretical Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

In this section, the circuit shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rc} is analysed
theoretically, in terms of the voltages and current intensities of the various branches and components of the circuit.

For convenience and coherence purposes, we chose to number the nodes of this circuit in the same manner that they will be numbered in the modified circuit used in the simulation. This means that nodes with the same number are in equivalent positions in the two circuits and explains why some numbers are skipped in this original circuit (the modified circuit has more nodes). In Section~\ref{sec:simulation} these modifications will be properly explained.
The nodes and meshes used in the following calculations are identified in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit_analysis}.

The values of the circuit Resistors, independent voltage and current sources, transconductance and transresistance were obtained by running the t1_datagen.py file and are shown in Table~\ref{tab:data}

\end{table}


\subsection{Mesh Method}

The circuit consists of multiple loops with various values of current, $i$, circulating in each of its branches. There are two
voltage sources, $v_a$ and $v_c$, driving their inputs. Applying the Mesh Method, which in this case consists of identifying the KVL equations for meshes A and C, as well as any other necessary additional equations, we reached a system of 5 equations and 5 unkowns, that was solved using the Octave math tools. Those equations are:

\begin{equation}
  mesh a -> v_a - R_1*i_a - R_3*(i_a + i_b) - R_4*(i_a +i_c) = 0.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  mesh c -> v_c - R_4*(i_a +i_c) - (R_6 +R_7)*i_c = 0.
\end{equation}

Additional equations:
$v_c = K_c*i_c$
$i_b = K_b*v_b$
$v_b = R_3*(i_a + i_b)$

The solution of this system of equations is presented in Table~\ref{tab:node}.

  \label{tab:node}
\end{table}


\subsection{Nodal Method}

Another way of analysing the circuit is by applying the Nodal Method, which consists of identifying the FCL equations for the nodes not connected to a voltage source, as well as any other necessary additional equations. In this particular case, this means analysing nodes 3, 4 and 6, which led us to a system of 11 equations and 11 unknowns. After obtaining these equations, we repeated the previous procedure and solved the system with the Octave software. The equations obtained by applying this method are:


\begin{equation}
  node 3 -> (v_3 - v_5)*G_3 + (v_3 - v_2)*G_1 + (v_3 - v_4)*G_2 = 0.
  \label{eq:kvl}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  node 4 -> (v_4 - v_3)*G_2 - i_b = 0.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  node 6 -> i_b - i_d + (v_6 - v_5)*G_5 = 0.
  \label{eq:kvl2}
\end{equation}

Additional equations:
$v_1= 0$
$v_2 - v_1 = v_a$
$v_3 - v_5 = v_b$
$v_5 - v_9 = v_c$
$i_b = K_b*v_b$
$v_c = K_c*I_c$
$v_9 - v_1 = -i_c*(r_6 + r_7)$
$node 1 -> (v_2 - v_3)*G_1 + i_c +(v_1 - v_5)*G_4 = 0$

The solution of this system of equations is presented in Table~\ref{tab:nodal}.
