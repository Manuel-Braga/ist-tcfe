\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We achieved the goal of analyzing the given circuit for this laboratory assignment. We've performed both a theoretical analysis using Octave and a circuit simulation using Ngspice. The values given by the simulation were coincident with the ones that we got from the theoretical results. As this is a fairly simple circuit without any non-linear components, this result was expected.
